# Image-Manipulation
## [Video Demo]()

## Prerequisite 
You need to have a set up for C language. I used Visual Studio and followed [this steps to set it up] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VE7p-he4fA) 

## TODO
### Download
Download the repository through Clone Repository or Download Zip
```
git clone https://github.com/Clair1234/Image-Manipulation.git
```
### Installation
After download, go to 'cmd' and navigate to the project folder directory
```
cd project
```
### Run 
If you are on VS Code run (Ctrl+Alt+N)

### Description
>[!NOTE]
>You have to put the image you want to manipulate in the same folder as the program

You will first be prompted the name of the image, here the image by default is : image.jpeg
You will get information on :
* the dimension
* the first pixel
* the tenth pixel
* the second line
* max pixel
* min pixel

You will then be prompted for transformation on the picture :
* Put a red filter on
* Put a green filter on
* Put a blue filter on
* Put a gray filter on
* Invert the color
* Put gray luminance
* Desaturate the colors
* Rotate clockwise
* Rotate anti clockwise
* Do a horizontal mirror
* Do a vertical mirror
* Do a total mirror

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Each file that results of the transformation will be named : image_out.jpeg and will be wiped out at each transformation so if you want to keep the image please download it before moving to the next transformation
